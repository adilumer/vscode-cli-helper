# VS Code CLI Helper

## The Problem And The Solution

In my current department, for some legacy systems, there are multiple console windows open on multiple machines, and its quite a hassle to manage and monitor all those windows and connections. Developing a detailed monitoring tool for somthing that is going to deprecate soon is an unnecessary effort, hence this extension. It is being planned such that it would utilize the integrated terminal from vscode for cli access and have a comprehesive dashboard for overview of running services.
